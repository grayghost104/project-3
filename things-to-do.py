# Welcome to plant vs zombies!
# You may have heard for plants vs zombies, but this ones very different!
# If you have never heard or played the game before, its very simple! In the oringal you pick your plants out of an inventory, then you see the "playing" field. Which is just the frontyard or backyard of Crazy Daves house, but then a number of zombies come at you plants slowly, trying to eat your brain and kill all of your plants! scary!!
# But in this version that I have created, you pick just one plant and choose the number of zombies you want the plant to go against. At the end you are able to see if you won, the zombies, or if everyone just died. Other aspects of the game include, being able to add your own plant, heal a plants health, and remove a plant for the entire inventory
