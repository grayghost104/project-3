# Welcome to plant vs zombies!
You may have heard for plants vs zombies, but this ones very different!
If you have never heard or played the game before, its very simple! In the oringal you pick your plants out of an inventory, then you see the "playing" field. Which is just the frontyard or backyard of Crazy Daves house, but then a number of zombies come at you plants slowly, trying to eat your brain and kill all of your plants! scary!!
